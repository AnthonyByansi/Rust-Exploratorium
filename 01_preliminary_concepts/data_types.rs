    Data types: Rust provides a rich set of data types to help you write safe and efficent code.
    1. Integer types: 
    `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`: Signed integers with different bit sizes
    `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`: Unsigned integers with different bit sizes
    `isize` and `usize`: Platform-dependent signed and unsigned integers
    
    2. FLoating-Point Types:
    `f32`: 32-bit floating point number(single precision)
    `f64`: 64-bit floating-point number (Double-precision)
    
    3. Boolean Type:
    `bool`: Represents either true or false
    
    4.Character Type:
    `char`: Represents a single Unicode Character
    
    5. String Types
    `&str`: A String Slice(a Reference to a string) that is oftern uses for read-only access
    `String`: A growable heap-allocated string
    
    6. Array Types:
    `[T, N]`: A fixed-size array of elements of type T
    
    7. Slice Types:
    `&[T]`: A dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence of elements of type `T`
    
    8. Tuple Types:
    `(T1, T2, ...)`: An ordered collection of elements, each with its own type.
    
    9. Function Types:
    `fn`: Represents a function type
    
    10. Pointer Types:
    `*const T` and `*mut T`: Raw pointers to data type `T`
    
    11. Reference Types:
    `&T`: Immutable reference to data of type `T`
    `&mut T`: Immutable reference to data of type `T`
    
    12. Option Types:
    `Option<T>`: Represents an Optional value, either `some(T)` or `None`
    
    13. Result Type:
    `Result<T, E>: Represents a result of an operation, either `Ok(T)` with a value of type `T` or `Err(E)` with an error of type `E`.
    
    14. Enumeration Types(Enums):
    `enum`: A Custom data type that represents one of a finite set of values

    15. Struct Types:
    `struct`: A custom data type that can group multiple values with different types
    
    16. Union Types:
    `union`: A type that can hold one of its fields at a time, useful for low-level memory manipulation.
    
    17. Closures:
    `fn`, `fnMut`, and `fnOnce`: Function-Like types that used to define closures
    
    18. Custom Types:
     we can define custom Data types using `struct` and `enum` declarations
     
    19. Slices and String Slices:
     These are references ti parts of arrays and strings, respectively
     
    20. References to Traits:
     References to Traits(e.g `&dyn Trait`) enable trait objects for dynamix dispatch
